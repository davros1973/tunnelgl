Fork by David Bayliss: changes 2017 Feb

I'm using this fork in an iframe at:

https://blog.xarta.co.uk/contact

Had to make changes (see commit) ...

Working in latest (at this time ... Feb 2017):
* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Chrome mobile (on Note 4)

But not Internet Explorer 11.5

There are still errors reported in Console.

My entire webpage works fine on a (year) 2009 Core 2 Duo laptop (in Chrome!).
The same laptop struggles with it in Edge.

Needs work. (I'm only just restarting to relearn JavaScript let alone three.js or WebGL ... so it's all a "work in progress")
